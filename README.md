# Visualising Tamil Nadu district level data using Python

## Modules used

BeautifulSoup, geopandas, matplotlib, geopandas

## How it works?

1)The district names are taken from the shapefile which has no attributes. <br/> 2) Using these district names their websites are 
parsed and data like population and number villages are taken and added to the shapefile. <br/> 3) Thus the empty shapefile is now populated with data. <br/> 4) Now it can be visualised using matplotlib and geopandas.
